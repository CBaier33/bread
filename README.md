# bread

we are tired of using spreadsheets to budget and diametrically opposed to paying for some garbage service that gives us none of the features we want, uses a subscription-based model and compromises privacy. we just want to stack bread.

## the philosophy

the inspiration for this project can be captured with the analogy of an imaginary, average young individual interested in personal finance, we'll call him brian.

brian onced used rocket money for his budgeting efforts, but was fed up with the ridiculous spam marketing tactics along with privacy-encroaching terms of service and guilt-pilled subscription strategies (e.g "How much are you comfortable paying?").

actually, brian was quite comfortable paying zero dollars for the service, apart from the fact that the "free" tier offered hardly any of the analytics or features that he really wanted.

eventually, brian's financial journey led him to the whimsical land of excel spreadsheets, a mysterious region inhabited by creatures such as "your grandmother", "old-as-dirt tech-leads," and a particularly repulsive species known as *business analysts*. with this solution, brian had the freedom to track and calculate his finances as he pleased, but it ended up being an extremely tedious process that never ended up looking right or being reliable.

you might wonder why brian didn't use a nifty self-hosted solution like firefly or actual?? well, brian is one of those people who just shrugs when he sees someone write hello world in python and says "it's all greek to me". opensource services are a nice option, but they aren't really geared for the average non-technical person who just wants to balance their checkbook, not spin up a docker container. additionally, the guis for these tools are often very outdated.

we took pity on people like brian and decided to build a platform that solves the issues of all these tools.

bread is a personal finance tool that allows anyone to simply and efficiently manage their budget, providing limitless analytics and customizability, guaranteed privacy, and ease-of-use.

bread stores data in a relational database, allowing the user to write queries for any analysis imaginable. more technical users can fork the project altogether and build their own components as well to support new features. the project is local-first and will never be a source of privacy risks to third-parties (we are considering encryption for physical attacks). finally, bread works out-of-the-box as a single executable. the average user should never need to visit this page and read this essay or need to sniff the terminal, he should be able to simply click install and start stacking bread.
